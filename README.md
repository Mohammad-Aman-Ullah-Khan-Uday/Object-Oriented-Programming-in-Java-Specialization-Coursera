[Object Oriented Programming in Java Specialization](https://coursera.org/share/dd95027b55c3458a9f3021b716ed5c1e) || [Certificate of Completion](https://coursera.org/share/dd95027b55c3458a9f3021b716ed5c1e)

This specialization includes four courses, detailed as follows:  
1\. Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software || [Certificate of Completion](https://coursera.org/share/72c53a1a796b53112eab23188edf7d2d)  
2\. Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data || [Certificate of Completion](https://coursera.org/share/853826751818f20b35f664690f14938e)  
3\. Object Oriented Programming in Java || [Certificate of Completion](https://coursera.org/share/fdf42497d4798e54f322b5ac08a73742)  
4\. Data Structures and Performance || [Certificate of Completion](https://coursera.org/share/f6e6ff95c7bf71b86b127b4ff90f9acc)

Throughout this specialization, I gained a comprehensive understanding of **Java programming** and key computer science concepts. Starting with the basics, I learned to write, compile, and run Java programs, covering fundamental concepts such as **methods**, **loops**, **conditionals**, and working with data structures like **arrays**, **ArrayLists**, and **HashMaps**.

As I progressed, I delved into **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles, understanding how to design and implement Java classes, manage **inheritance** and **polymorphism**, and create efficient, modular code. This also included hands-on experience with developing **graphical user interfaces (GUIs)** and implementing **event-driven programming** for interactive applications.

Additionally, I explored more advanced topics in **data structures** and **algorithm design**, where I implemented and analyzed structures like **LinkedLists**, **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)**, and **Tries**. This included learning **sorting algorithms** (Selection, Insertion, Merge, and Quick Sort) and conducting **performance analysis** using **Big-O** notation and benchmarking techniques to measure efficiency.

Throughout the specialization, I worked on various practical projects such as:

* **String manipulation** and **data analysis** using **Apache Commons CSV** for tasks like analyzing DNA sequences and baby name trends.  
* Cryptography-related projects where I implemented and broke ciphers, including the **Vigenère Cipher**, while working with **HashSet** and **HashMap**.  
* Analyzing web server logs to track user visits, using **IP addresses** and **timestamps**.

I also developed a solid foundation in **testing strategies** using **JUnit**, which helped ensure the robustness and performance of the applications I built. Overall, this specialization significantly enhanced my problem-solving skills, deepened my understanding of core Java concepts, and equipped me to develop efficient, well-structured software.
