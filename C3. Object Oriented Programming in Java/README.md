In this course, I gained a solid understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java, focusing on the creation and manipulation of classes and objects. I learned about key concepts such as member variables, methods, constructors, and method overloading, along with the significance of access modifiers like public and private. The hands-on assignments helped reinforce these skills, allowing me to trace code execution and apply variable scope effectively.

As I progressed, I explored advanced topics like inheritance and polymorphism, utilizing the extended keyword and understanding class hierarchies. I also developed graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and implemented event-driven programming, making my applications interactive. Additionally, I examined searching and sorting algorithms, enhancing my understanding of algorithm efficiency. By the end of the course, I successfully completed a project that integrated these concepts, solidifying my foundation in OOP and preparing me for future programming challenges.

Wishing you a joyful learning experience\! Have a great day\!
