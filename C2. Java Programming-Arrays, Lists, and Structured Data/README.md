[Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data](https://coursera.org/share/853826751818f20b35f664690f14938e) || [Certificate of Completion](https://coursera.org/share/853826751818f20b35f664690f14938e)

In this course, I acquired a comprehensive understanding of the basics of cryptography, particularly focusing on the historical development and application of simpler cryptographic systems used from ancient times through the early 20th century. I implemented various ciphers and explored techniques for cryptanalysis, enhancing my problem-solving skills in string manipulation and data structures such as arrays.

Key competencies developed during the course include:

1\. **String Processing and Manipulation**: I gained proficiency in combining strings through concatenation and utilizing the \`StringBuilder\` class in Java for efficient string handling.  
2\. **Data Structures**: I worked with arrays to store and manipulate indexed sequences of elements, and employed \`ArrayList\` and \`HashMap\` to manage collections of data.  
3\. **Object-Oriented Design**: I refactored programs to improve organization and flexibility, applying object-oriented principles to structure code.  
4\. **Algorithm Design**: I practiced designing algorithms to solve real-world problems.

Notable projects included the development of a **word frequency counter** for text analysis and a **GladLibs** application, where I utilized *ArrayList* and *HashMap* to dynamically substitute words in templates. I also learned to identify and correct brittle code by implementing more flexible, object-oriented designs.

In a module on web server logs, I developed a program to analyze website traffic, including counting unique visitors and tracking repeated visits using IP addresses and timestamps.

Finally, I completed an in-depth project to break the **Vigen√®re Cipher**, progressively enhancing my program to decrypt messages with varying complexity, including unknown key lengths and different languages. Through this project, I advanced my use of *HashSet* and *HashMap* and deepened my understanding of designing algorithms capable of handling more complex, multi-class systems.

Learning never exhausts the mind. Happy learning\!
