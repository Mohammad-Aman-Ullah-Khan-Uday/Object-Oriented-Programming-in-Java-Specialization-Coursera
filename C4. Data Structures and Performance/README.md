[Data Structures and Performance](https://coursera.org/share/f6e6ff95c7bf71b86b127b4ff90f9acc) || [Certificate of Completion](https://coursera.org/share/f6e6ff95c7bf71b86b127b4ff90f9acc)

In this course, I learned key concepts in data structures, algorithm analysis, and Java programming:  
\- Distinguished between Abstract Data Types (ADTs) and data structures.  
\- Worked with Java structures like *LinkedList*, *HashMap*, and *TreeSet*, and implemented structures like Linked Lists and Tries.  
\- Analyzed algorithm performance using Big-O and benchmarking.  
\- Compared sorting algorithms (Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick Sort) and their best/worst cases.  
\- Implemented and traversed Binary Search Trees (BSTs) and Tries.  
\- Explored hash tables, hash functions, and collision handling.  
\- Developed testing strategies with JUnit and measured code performance using Java timing libraries.

These skills helped me design efficient, performance-optimized algorithms and data structures.
