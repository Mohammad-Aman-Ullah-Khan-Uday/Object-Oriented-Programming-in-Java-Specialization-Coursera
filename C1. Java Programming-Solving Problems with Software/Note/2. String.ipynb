    "## Section 1. The basics of String\n",
    "\n",
    "As is briefly covered in Chapter 1, data that do not belong to primitive data types are considered reference data. There are eight primitive data types, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* byte\n",
    "* short\n",
    "* int\n",
    "* long\n",
    "* float\n",
    "* double\n",
    "* char\n",
    "* boolean\n",
    "\n",
    "String is considered a reference data type. As a result, the conventional way of initializing and declaring a string variable would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "String s = new String(\"Hello world\");\n",
    "System.out.println(s); // Hello world\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you initialize a String variable without declaring it, it will default to null. Note that null stands for \"having no value at all\", which is different from an empty string \"\", which is a string with no characters in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "String s;\n",
    "System.out.println(s); // null\n",
    "\n",
    "String s = new String(\"\");\n",
    "System.out.println(s); // noting to print - empty string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An initialized and declared string should be treated as a single immutable item. In other words, once a string is created, it can not be changed or partially updated. However, a string is also a sequence of characters (data type char). For instance, given a string \"Java is fun.\", the indexes corresponding to the characters are:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/indexes.png\" alt=\"index\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the characters in this string, you can use the method charAt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "String str = \"Java is fun.\";\n",
    "System.out.println(str.charAt(8)); // f\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that charAt accepts an integer as the only parameter, which stands for the index of character you want to access. It returns a char at the specified index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please also note that the method charAt is accessed by concatenating the defined string variable named \"str\" and the method \"charAt\" with a dot. This is what we call the dot notation. Java uses dot notation to access methods and fields defined underneath a class. In our example, you can think that String is a class defined in Java library, and charAt is a public method defined underneath String class. To access charAt, you need to have an initialized and declared String variable (e.g., str) first. After that, you can access the method by saying str.charAt(...). The same can be said for \"System.out.println()\": System is a class in the java.lang package . The out is a static member of the System class, and is an instance of java.io.PrintStream . The println is a method of java.io.PrintStream (*I certainly know this souds crazy*).\n",

    "## Section 2. Three Important Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Three most commonly used string methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* length\n",
    "* +\n",
    "* equals\n",
    "\n",
    "\"length\" method is used to get the length of a Java String. The string length method returns the number of characters written in the String. When you traverse a string character by character, this method is often used as the cap for the iterator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "String str = new String(\"Java is fun.\");\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {\n",
    "    System.out.println(str.charAt(i)); // print characters line by line\n",
    "}\n",
    "System.out.println();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that there is a bracket that follows \".length\", which is different from many other linear data structures (e.g., array). This is an unfortunate inconsistency in Java. You will get used to it given some time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"+\" method is used to concatenate a string with another item of any data types and returns the concatenated item as another string. \"+\" is used a lot when you have dynamically changed stuff to print:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n",
    "    System.out.println(\"Output number: \" + i); // Output number: x\n",
    "}\n",
    "System.out.println();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\"equals\" is used to check the value equivalence of two given strings. String is a reference data type. When you initialize and declare a reference object (e.g., String str), its variable name and the actual objects are stored in different places in the memory of a computer. They are connected through a link we call pointer. In the contexts of String (as a reference data type), \"==\" is used for reference comparison (whether they are the same objects), while .equals() is used for content comparison (whether two objects have the same content). For instance, you can make two string variables with exactly the same values, but they would actually be two different objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "String s = new String(\"Hello world\");\n",
    "String t = new String(\"Hello world\");\n",
    "System.out.println(s == t); // return false\n",
    "System.out.println(s.equals(t)); // return true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
