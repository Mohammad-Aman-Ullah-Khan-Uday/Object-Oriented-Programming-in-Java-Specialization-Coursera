In the “[Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/3X0V9QTSM8WE)” course, I'll start by diving into the basics of Java programming, including writing and running simple programs, understanding syntax, and using methods, variables, loops, and conditionals. I'll get hands-on with BlueJ for compiling and running my programs and work with Iterables to handle multiple lines or files. As I move forward, I'll focus on strings, learning how to manipulate and analyze them to solve problems like finding genes in DNA sequences. I'll also tackle CSV files using the Apache Commons CSV library, which will help me analyze and manipulate data, perform statistical analysis, and manage "null" values. Finally, I'll wrap up the course with a mini project where I'll use all these skills to analyze trends in baby name data, bringing everything I've learned together.
